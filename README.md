# frontend-challenge

Hello, developer :wave:!

Welcome to the Tabia frontend challenge.

> **_NOTE:_** This challenge is part of the hiring process. We assume here that you are already in contact with someone at Tabia.

## Instructions

In this challenge, we expect you to:

- Implement a runnable application respecting the layout indication provided on [this prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/OEBEuaoyJw4cUA0fTtNN2W/Challenge);
- Create a responsive layout, with good support to mobile devices;
- Write all code and documentation in english.

Functional requirements

- The team names and grades for each metric should be dynamic and defined on a JSON file
- The values shown on the top row should be the averages of each column (the prototype is not considering this point)

Some other desired requirements are:

- Write unit tests;
- Justify design choices, arguing about costs and benefits involved. You may write those as comments inline or, if you wish, provide a separate document summarizing those choices;

> If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us.

## Solve the challenge

There is no unique solution to this challenge. The main intent is to evaluate candidate's ability and familiarity with tools and best practices.

To solve this challenge, you may create a new *private* repository on your profile, then provide access to:

[@hubefonseca](https://github.com/hubefonseca)

Alternatively, you can send us a [git patch file](https://www.devroom.io/2009/10/26/how-to-create-and-apply-a-patch-with-git/) with your changes.
