# frontend-challenge

Hello, developer :wave:!

Welcome to the Telic frontend challenge.

## Instructions

In this challenge, we expect you to:

- Follow the layout indication provided on the prototypes;
- Implement a responsive layout, with good support to mobile devices;
- Provide a runnable application;
- Write all code and documentation in english.

Some other desired requirements are:

- Write unit tests;
- Justify design choices, arguing about costs and benefits involved. You may write those as comments inline or, if you wish, provide a separate document summarizing those choices;

## Solve the challenge

There is no unique solution to this challenge. The main intent is to evaluate candidate's ability and familiarity with tools and best practices.

To solve this challenge, you may create a new *private* repository on your profile, then provide access to:
