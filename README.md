# frontend-challenge

Hello, developer :wave:!

Welcome to the Telic frontend challenge.

In this challenge, we expect you to:

- Follow the layout indication provided on the prototypes provided;
- Write tests;
- Justify design choices, arguing about costs and benefits involved. You may write those as comments inline or, if you wish, provide a separate document summarizing those choices;
- Write all code and documentation in english


There is no unique solution to this challenge. The intent is to evaluate candidate's ability and familiarity with tools and best practices.

To solve this challenge, you may fork this repository in a *private* repo on your profile, then provide access to:

[@hubefonseca](https://github.com/hubefonseca)

Alternatively, if you do not want to have this repo on your profile (we totally get it), send us a git patch file with your changes.
